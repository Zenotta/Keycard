# Keycard

A small service that takes care of all your Zenotta blockchain integration, so you can just focus on making great games.
<b>NOTE: This service is currently intended for testing purposes, and should not be used in a production environment!</b>

<br />

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üì¶ Getting Started

Keycard assumes an existing NodeJS installation (v16.14.2 tested) as well as associated npm, with which
you can install and then run the service

```
npm install
npm start
```

<br />

## üíª Usage

Keycard currently only provides 2 routes for handling blockchain asset creation and sending.

### Creating Blockchain Items

Zenotta uses `Receipt` assets to provide NFT-like ownership, and you can think of `Receipts` in 
Zenotta as the same thing as blockchain items/NFTs. These can be created by making a
call to `create_blockchain_item` as below:

```typescript
// POST
axios
  .post("/create_blockchain_item", {
    amount: 1000, // Number of items to create
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
  });
```

<b>Example Response Content</b>

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "reason": "OK",
    "content": {
        "toAddress": "b46f37...3bfb01",
        "receiptAsset": {
            "amount": 1000,
            "drs_tx_hash": "YOUR_TX_HASH"
        }
    }
}
```
<br/>

* `toAddress` - Your address where the `Receipt` assets were sent to 
* `receiptAsset` - Details of the `Receipt` asset created. The `drs_tx_hash` can be used to spend this item later


<br />

### Sending Blockchain Items to Players

In order to send `Receipt` blockchain items you'll need the following:

1. <b>The item's transaction hash:</b> This is the `drs_tx_hash` value you would've received from the call to 
`/create_blockchain_item`. This value tells the blockchain which item you want to send and acts as an identifier.

2. <b>The amount of this item to send:</b> A simple integer value

3. <b>The player's Zenotta address:</b> This is the address the player provides to the game to make payments to

With these 3 values you can make a call to Keycard at:

```typescript
// POST
axios
  .post("/send_blockchain_item", {
    amount: 1000,               // Number of items to send
    address: "046b37...3bfb09"  // Player address
    txHash: "YOUR_TX_HASH"      // The blockchain item's `drs_tx_hash`
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
  });
```

<b>Example Response Content</b>

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "reason": "OK",
    "content": null
}
```
